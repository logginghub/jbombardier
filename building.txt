Now everything has been migrated over to gradle, building is less Heath-Robinson, but sadly is back to having a new manual steps...

1. gradle clean test     : to make sure everything is happy
2. git status            : to make sure you've got everything squared away
3. gradle install        : to deploy artifacts in the local maven repo, if you are building or compiling anything locally that needs the update
4. gradle distZip        : to build the deployable zip files
5. gradle uploadArchives : to deploy the artifacts and zip files to the remote repo at www.vertexlabs.co.uk

gradle install distZip uploadArchives

6. git -tag [version number] : tag the release in git
7. Edit build.gradle and increase the version number
8. git commit -a -m "Ready for next version"
9. git push --tags
